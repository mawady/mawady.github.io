# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "In recent years, there has been renewed interest in bilateral symmetry detection in images. It consists in detecting the main bilateral symmetry axis inside artificial or natural images. State-of-the-art methods combine feature point detection, pairwise comparison and voting in Hough-like space. In spite of their good performance, they fail to give reliable results over challenging real-world and artistic images. In this paper, we propose a novel symmetry detection method using multi-scale edge features combined with local orientation histograms. An experimental evaluation is conducted on public datasets plus a new aesthetic-oriented dataset. The results show that our approach outperforms all other concurrent methods."
