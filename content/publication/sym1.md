# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Symmetry is one of the significant visual properties inside an image plane, to identify the geometrically balanced structures through real-world objects. Existing symmetry detection methods rely on descriptors of the local image features and their neighborhood behavior, resulting incomplete symmetrical axis candidates to discover the mirror similarities on a global scale. In this paper, we propose a new reflection symmetry detection scheme, based on a reliable edge-based feature extraction using Log-Gabor filters, plus an efficient voting scheme parameterized by their corresponding textural and color neighborhood information. Experimental evaluation on four single-case and three multiple-case symmetry detection datasets validates the superior achievement of the proposed work to find global symmetries inside an image."
