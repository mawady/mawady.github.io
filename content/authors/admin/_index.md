I am an university lecturer in data science at university of Stirling. Previously, I was a lead computer vision researcher at Parisian startup [Qopius](https://qopius.com/). In 2019, i was awarded PhD degree in computer vision at Hubert Curien laboratory - Lyon university, under the supervision of [Christophe Ducottet](https://perso.univ-st-etienne.fr/ducottet/) (Leader, Image Analysis and Understanding team). I was previously a MSc intern at Heriot-Watt university, Edinburgh in the school of engineering and physical science, Vision lab under the supervision of [Neil M. Robertson](https://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/neil-robertson(41defca3-1fb7-41ed-b427-583d1baf7602).html) (Director of research for speech, image and vision systems, Queen's university of Belfast). In addition, i was awarded triple-degree 2-years european masters in Vision and Robotics [(VIBOT)](https://www.vibot.org/) with Erasmus Mundus scholarship (2012-2014). Plus, I am the winner of 2D reflection symmetry competitions (among participants) in ICCV'17 workshop: detecting symmetry in the Wild.
