In 2019, i was awarded PhD degree in Computer Vision at Hubert Curien laboratory - Lyon University, under the supervision of [Christophe Ducottet](https://perso.univ-st-etienne.fr/ducottet/) (Leader, Image Analysis and Understanding team). I was previously MSc intern at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh in the School of Engineering and Physical Science, Vision Lab under the supervision of [Neil M. Robertson](https://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/neil-robertson(41defca3-1fb7-41ed-b427-583d1baf7602).html) (Director of Research for Speech, Image and Vision Systems, Queen's University of Belfast). In addition, i was awarded triple-degree 2-years European Masters in Vision and Robotics [(VIBOT)](https://www.vibot.org/) with Erasmus Mundus Scholarship (2012-2014). Plus, I am the winner of 2D reflection symmetry competitions (among participants) in ICCV'17 Workshop: Detecting Symmetry in the Wild.
